# Database-optimization-using-indexes
In this project is I help a database administrator optimize a set of queries.by looking carefully at the database schema,the data inserted within the database,table sizes and nature of values inside in the table.
# The following files are provided along with your project description:
## schema.sql: contains the SQL commands that create the tables with the schema shown in the figure
## insert-data.sql: contains the SQL commands that will load/insert rows in the tables created
## project1-queries-v1.sql: contains 17 queries to be optimized individualy
## create index only: contains index commands used to optimize each query and the database schema in general, and (3) a
## pdf file that contains the following:
### a) The indices created to optimize the schema
### b) For each of the 17 queries, list which attribute you will create an index on and which index type
you will use along with justification
### c) Providing statistics about the index usage, query plan time, and query execution time for each
query
### d) List the tps and average latency for each query before and after creating an index (expected 34 tps
and latency values)
### e) Compare the tps and latency values before and after adding the index for every query and provide
a justification for the observed behavior
